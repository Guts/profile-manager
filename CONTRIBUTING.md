# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for considering to contribute to this project!

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Git hooks

We use git hooks through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce and automatically check some "rules". Please install them (`pre-commit install`) before to push any commit.

See the relevant configuration file: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
